    <h2>This is literally a perfect Omelet</h2>
    <p>... and you will literally never make such a perfect creation with your subpar cooking technique. You disgust me.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt, Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat pan over low heat</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs until homogenous</li>
        <li>Pour eggs into pan, constantly stirring</li>
        <li>Oh fuck, your pan was too hot, now they are overcooked and its going to be a bitch to fold</li>
        <li>Fold one side over the other</li>
        <li>Good job, you made a barely edible creation, which doesnt resemble the picture above at all</li>
        <li>Hate yourself</li>
    </ol>
